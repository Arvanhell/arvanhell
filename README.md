Hello there! My name is Cezary, I am self-taught programmer. Diving into code every day to learn something new
I've got a colorful palette of interests! 
I love coding, I am fascinating with the intricate art of technology, 
crafting solutions through lines of code. It's a canvas where creativity meets problem-solving.
I love books. My passion for knowledge come from Each book I read, It was opens a portal to a new world, 
allowing imagination to roam free.
I love drawing. Drawing is a beautiful form of expression, a way to create own visual stories. 
Whether through pencil strokes or digital art, it's a canvas for emotions and ideas.
I love also watching movies. Movies offer a different kind of storytelling, transporting to diverse 
landscapes and narratives. 
They can inspire, entertain, and sometimes, provoke thought.

Those moments create cherished memories, woven with love and laughter.
